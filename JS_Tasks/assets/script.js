//Declaring variables using variables:

var city = "Anantpur";
const age = 20;
let country = "India";

city = "Tadipatri";
//age = 30;
// Since const value could'nt be re-assigned so we get error in the console 
country = "Ireland";

console.log("Country:", country);
console.log("City:", city);
console.log("Age:", age);


//Declaring the variables using let and checking the o/p for re-assigning and re-declaring it:

let age_x = 27;

console.log("Age:", age_x);

age_x = 54;

console.log("Age:", age_x);

//let age_x = 81;

//console.log("Age:", age_x); 

//If we re-declare any variable console will throw an error because the variable is already declared and we can re-assign the values accordingly.


//Checking the o/p of the variable using var

var name_x = "Ravi Teja Reddy";

console.log("Name:", name_x);

name_x = "Tej Reddy";

console.log("Name:", name_x);
